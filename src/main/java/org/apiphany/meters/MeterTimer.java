/**
 * A specialized {@link Meter} that measures the duration of events.
 * <p>
 * Timers are used to record how long operations take to complete, typically to analyze latencies, throughput, or
 * performance characteristics of code paths. Each recorded {@link Duration} contributes to a set of statistics such as
 * total time, number of events, and distribution (depending on the underlying implementation).
 *
 * <h2>Usage example:</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * MeterTimer requestTimer = registry.timer("http.requests");
 *
 * // Record a known duration
 * requestTimer.record(Duration.ofMillis(250));
 *
 * // Record the execution of a code block
 * long start = System.nanoTime();
 * try {
 * 	service.processRequest();
 * } finally {
 * 	Duration elapsed = Duration.ofNanos(System.nanoTime() - start);
 * 	requestTimer.record(elapsed);
 * }
 * }</pre>
